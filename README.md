I am the developer of this iOS application, called HarshFlix. I've used third-party movies in this application to save movies trailer for later viewing. This app was developed using 100% programming in Swift; no storyboard is used. This app also supports dark and light modes on the iPhone; if you want, you can play with them. Apple's own database CoreData is used for local storage of saved movies.I also added amazing visual effects so that you will have fun using this application. By using this application, you will be able to enjoy your favourite film trailer at the appropriate moment and avoid missing any of your favourite filmmakers' or celebrities' films with the aid of this application's numerous tabs, including popular, trending, in cinema, top-rated, and upcoming films with ratings.I used various resources to make this application like youtube, stack-overflow and others.


Not only that, but you can watch the movie trailer within the app itself thanks to Google YouTube's API. The icing on the cake is that you can use the movies search option to look up your favourite movies.


You can watch more photos and full video of the app in my GitHub link. This 100% working project. Right now this app is not available in apple app store.lets hope best for the future availability.
